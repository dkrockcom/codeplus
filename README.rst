###################
What is Codeplus
###################

Codeplus is an Rest API Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build back-end using PHP.
Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, 
by providing a rich set of business libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple and logical structure to access controllers. 
Codeplus lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.


*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
